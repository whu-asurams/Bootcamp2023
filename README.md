# The website for Bootcamp2023 at Albany State University

## Major webpages
The website is developed based on Bootstrap 5.0. There are five major html files:
1. index.html 
2. week1.html
3. week2.html
4. week3.html
5. week4.html

## Layout of week1.html to week4.html
The layout of each week's html page is pretty much the same. They contains about 100 line of codes. The detailed contents are created using JavaScript to reduce the errors. There are two js files used for each week's html page. For instance, for week 1, the files
  ```
       <script src="./createHTMLNode.js">
       </script>
       <script src="./week1.js">
       </script> 
  ```
